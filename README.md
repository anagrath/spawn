Spawn renamed to Spawnling
=====

If you're looking for the gem that provides easy spawning of sub-processes, you're in the right place.

But, because of name conflicts with another gem named spawn, I had to rename this gem to "spawnling".
If you're looking for the old "spawn" gem, please go to [the spawnling repo](//github.com/tra/spawnling).
